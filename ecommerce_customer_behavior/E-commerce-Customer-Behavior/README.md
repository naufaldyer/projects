# E-commerce-Customer-Behavior

This is the project I used for the Modeling competition held by Hactiv8. In this project I use data that contains consumer activity on e-commers which I use to predict whether items that have been added to the shopping cart will be purchased or not. I used 3 machine learning models for comparison, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. In this competition, I became a Finalist (out of 20 participants) and had the opportunity to present in front of the judges.

There are 2 Notebooks in the repository, e-commerce customer behavior version 1 and e-commerce customer behavior version 2. For e-commerce customer behavior version 1, this is the notebook I used for the evaluation session by the judges and for version 2, this is the notebook which I use to show the difference in predictive results when using different preprocessing methods.
